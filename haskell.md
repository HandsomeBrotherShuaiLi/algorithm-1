[Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. 
In imperative languages you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of tasks and then it executes them. While executing them, it can change state.

Haskell is statically typed.

Haskell uses a very good type system that has type inference.
